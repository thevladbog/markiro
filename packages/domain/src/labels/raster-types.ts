 * PACKAGE-BOUNDARY NOTE (Plan 04 controller decision, pinned here for both
 * this task and Task 4 to read): Task 4 ("raster primitives") lives in
 * `./raster.ts`. It owns the PIXEL-LEVEL conversion functions that PRODUCE a
 * `RasterResult` — `convertToMonochrome`, `bitmapToZplHex`,
 * `bitmapToTsplBytes` — and imports the two types below from this module
 * rather than redeclaring them. `buildGfaCommand` and `buildBitmapCommand`
 * are defined HERE (Tasks 2/3, the ZPL/TSPL emitters), not in Task 4's
 * raster module, because they are pure printer-language command-string
 * assembly (`^GFA` field syntax / TSPL `BITMAP` syntax), not raster math —
 * these modules' golden tests needed working implementations before Task 4
 * existed, and Task 4's own tests import them back from here, so there is
 * exactly one implementation of each, never two that could silently drift
 * apart. `invertHexToTsplBytes` (below) is exported for exactly one reason:
 * so that Task 4's `bitmapToTsplBytes` can reuse this exact inversion
 * instead of re-deriving it — `raster-types.ts` remains the single source
 * of truth for ZPL<->TSPL bit-polarity; `raster.ts` only packs pixels and
 * delegates the polarity flip back here.

 * `String.fromCharCode` — ready to embed inline as TSPL `BITMAP`'s raw
 * binary data parameter.
 *
 * POLARITY: ZPL's `^GFA` and TSPL's `BITMAP` (mode 0 / OVERWRITE) do NOT
 * agree on bit polarity. ZPL follows the "obvious" convention (bit 1 =
 * printed/black, matching `bitmapToZplHex`'s own documented semantics).
 * TSPL is the opposite: bit 0 = printed/black, bit 1 = blank/white. This
 * was confirmed against a real, working TSPL image-printing implementation
 * (rowbotik/thermal-printer-server's `image_to_tspl`: it inverts the
 * grayscale source (`255 - p`) and thresholds it BEFORE packing, then sets
 * a bit only when the (already-inverted) sample is `< 128` — net effect,
 * an originally-black source pixel ends up as bit 0 in the byte stream
 * handed to `BITMAP ...,0,<data>`), and is also what the plan's Global
 * Constraints note anticipated. TSC's own official TSPL/TSPL2 Programming
 * Manual's worked `BITMAP` example (the "BITMAP 200,200,2,16,0,..." sample)
 * does not state the polarity in words, so this comment — not the manual
 * text — is the citable source; Plan 05's hardware verification pass
 * should still print a small asymmetric test bitmap on a physical TSC
 * printer to double-check before this ships to production.
 *
 * Inverting EVERY bit (not just the columns inside the logical image width)
 * is intentional and correct: it also flips this package's ZPL white/0 row
 * padding (see `bitmapToZplHex`) into TSPL's white/1 padding convention, so
 * padding columns stay blank under either polarity.
 *
 * Exported (rather than module-private) specifically so `raster.ts`'s
 * `bitmapToTsplBytes` can reuse this exact inversion instead of
 * re-implementing it — see the PACKAGE-BOUNDARY NOTE at the top of this

/**
 * Computes the extra x-offset (in dots) a rasterized-text bitmap must be

 * native-text branch does (ZPL's `^FB` block / TSPL's `TEXT` alignment
 * parameter both anchor relative to the element's declared box, not its raw
 * `x`) — without this offset the raster branch would always anchor the
 * bitmap flush to the element's bare `x`, silently dropping `align` for any
 * text that happens to need rasterization (Cyrillic/CJK/etc.).
 *
 * `align: "left"` (or unset) needs no offset: the native path's default
 * already anchors flush-left at `x`, exactly where the raster bitmap is
 * drawn regardless. `"center"` splits the leftover space
 * (`maxWidthDots - rasterWidthDots`) evenly on both sides, rounding to the
 * nearest whole dot (a fractional dot can't be rendered) via `Math.round`.
 * `"right"` shifts the bitmap flush to the box's trailing edge, i.e. by the
 * FULL leftover space.
 *
 * Both branches are clamped to a minimum of 0: if the rasterized bitmap
 * turns out WIDER than `maxWidthDots` (a long/dense piece of text at a
 * fixed font size — the model does not shrink text to fit), there is no
 * leftover space to distribute and the bitmap stays anchored at `x`, the
 * same graceful degradation the native `^FB`/alignment paths exhibit rather
 * than emitting a negative, off-label offset.
 *
 * With no `maxWidthMm` on the element (`maxWidthDots === undefined`) there
 * is no box to align within, so the offset is always 0 regardless of
 * `align` — matching TSPL's native-text behavior, where `align` without a
 * width is meaningless (see `tspl.ts`'s `renderTextLikeElement` doc
 * comment), and keeping ZPL's raster and native paths consistent with each
 * other for the same case.
 *
 * A single pure function (not duplicated per emitter) so `zpl.ts`,
 * `tspl.ts`, and (via a re-export chain, ultimately from `@markiro/domain`)
 * `apps/admin`'s `PreviewPane.tsx` compositor all apply the EXACT same
 * arithmetic — the preview and the two print-document emitters can never
 * silently drift apart on this offset.
